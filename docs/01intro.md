### 📑 Concept Statement
Is it a puzzle game in which an alien must find his way home? This is where you outline what the main idea of the game will be.

Further along, this is the lovechild between the high concept and pitch. This is where you outline and describe all of the aspects of the game. We’re talking story, demographics, risk analysis and a boatload of further information.

Setting
This is where your world can take shape.

Genre
What genre is your game? This is where you write down your aims in terms of what the game will turn out to be. 

## Game Document
Create a Reference for Your Entire Team

Brainstorm
Write everything down. Let it sit for a day. Then come back to it.
why you’re making the game;
what the game is;
what the point of it is; and
what you’re trying to accomplish.

Discuss
A game design document is at its best when it’s verified. Prototype the major elements and build from there.

Experiment
At the heart of great games are great ideas. Fueling creativity can keep morale high and lead to excellent games. It can also lead to surprise last-minute additions that end up being one of the game’s best features.

Solidify
While it’s good to be flexible at some points during the creation of your game development guide, there comes a time where you need to "publish" it.
It shouldn’t be changed anymore. This is the end of the Game development guide’s "life," so to speak. It has gone through its chrysalis phase, and it has emerged as a butterfly, never to change again.

Who Should You Write to?
Is specifically for your team, first and foremost.
So write like it.
Use technical, descriptive language to describe elements of the game in detail.
Language is an important element to consider as well. You want this game design document to be useful, not boring. Why? Because no one wants to read a boring manual. If you make the game design document a reflection of the fun behind the game and personality of your team, your team will be more willing to reference it. No one wants to open a document that’s going to suck the fun out of them.

Don’t Forget the Why of the Design Document
The whole point of the game design document is to keep everyone on the same page. Words aren’t always the best way to do this, so don’t be afraid to supplement your explanations with visual material.
Concept art, for example, plays a vital role in the game design document. Storyboard art can help describe scenes or the feeling of the game.

Once it’s Built, Set the Deadlines
A game design document isn’t helpful if none of its parts come to fruition. Use the document to prioritize tasks–what are the most important elements to figure out now?–the ones that will make the rest of the game easier to build?
Set deadlines on these tasks.

Ch-ch-changes
Keep the changes updated in the document–you might want to put everything you replace at the end of the document.
