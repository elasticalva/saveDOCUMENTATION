#### 1. Game Document
Create a Reference for Your Entire Team

Brainstorm
Write everything down. Let it sit for a day. Then come back to it.
why you’re making the game;
what the game is;
what the point of it is; and
what you’re trying to accomplish.

Discuss
A game design document is at its best when it’s verified. Prototype the major elements and build from there.

Experiment
At the heart of great games are great ideas. Fueling creativity can keep morale high and lead to excellent games. It can also lead to surprise last-minute additions that end up being one of the game’s best features.

Solidify
While it’s good to be flexible at some points during the creation of your game development guide, there comes a time where you need to "publish" it.
It shouldn’t be changed anymore. This is the end of the Game development guide’s "life," so to speak. It has gone through its chrysalis phase, and it has emerged as a butterfly, never to change again.

Who Should You Write to?
Is specifically for your team, first and foremost.
So write like it.
Use technical, descriptive language to describe elements of the game in detail.
Language is an important element to consider as well. You want this game design document to be useful, not boring. Why? Because no one wants to read a boring manual. If you make the game design document a reflection of the fun behind the game and personality of your team, your team will be more willing to reference it. No one wants to open a document that’s going to suck the fun out of them.

Don’t Forget the Why of the Design Document
The whole point of the game design document is to keep everyone on the same page. Words aren’t always the best way to do this, so don’t be afraid to supplement your explanations with visual material.
Concept art, for example, plays a vital role in the game design document. Storyboard art can help describe scenes or the feeling of the game.

Once it’s Built, Set the Deadlines
A game design document isn’t helpful if none of its parts come to fruition. Use the document to prioritize tasks–what are the most important elements to figure out now?–the ones that will make the rest of the game easier to build?
Set deadlines on these tasks.

Ch-ch-changes
Keep the changes updated in the document–you might want to put everything you replace at the end of the document.

## :smile: 1. Meet the Team
Before you begin or show your game design template to others, you need to familiarize yourself with the team undertaking the feat of developing. This seems obvious, but meeting and collaborating with others will only make it easier for you to design games and projects further.

## :bookmark_tabs: 2. Concept Statement
Is it a puzzle game in which an alien must find his way home? This is where you outline what the main idea of the game will be.

Further along, this is the lovechild between the high concept and pitch. This is where you outline and describe all of the aspects of the game. We’re talking story, demographics, risk analysis and a boatload of further information.

Setting
This is where your world can take shape.

Genre
What genre is your game? This is where you write down your aims in terms of what the game will turn out to be. 

- #### :blue_book: 2.1 The Story
Delving deeper, you need to flesh out the descriptions of the story, setting, and who the characters will eventually be.

- #### :busts_in_silhouette: 2.2 Characters
What are their wants, needs, and motivations? This is where you fully flesh out our protagonists, antagonists, ancillary characters, and more.


- #### :game_die: 2.3 Mechanics
The game mechanics refer to different aspects of the game. Very simply, they are the visuals, sounds, animations, physics, and more.

game mechanic = gameplay how player interacts with the game. Game mechanics help provide gameplay by providing a construct of methods or rules designed for the player to interact with. A game designer’s main role is to come up with game mechanics that are engaging enough to either entertain a player or give them an impacting and worthwhile experience.

Core, Primary, Secondary Mechanics

The one thing every game designer wants to avoid is having a list of great ideas on paper that don’t transition well in their video game. When an experienced designer receives overwhelming feedback about their game being too repetitive, they’ll often look back and see what other game mechanics they can add to make the game more interesting. If players say your game is boring or gets old quickly, it might be time to spice up existing game mechanics with better rewards and effects, or by giving them more depth.

setting what kind of stats, HP etc you want. This is part of the player experience and the math should fit 'around' these values.

The huge thing is balance, it would probably be a good idea to create an interactive program (say in C# or something quick) where you can change stats and see what kind of results you get. Consider using Excel to do this.

The most important question is: Which formula gives players the most fun?
If it stats or damage go up too fast players get insensitized, if it goes up to slowly they get bored. Players need to feel happy when they gain a level, so they need to feel like they put work into it and also that it will have some noticeable effect on their game performance.

Creating formulas like this requires knowledge of elementary mathematical functions
Once you have those mastered, just ask yourself (replace "value" with "damage," or "health," or "speed" or whatever):

Do you want the value to grow at a constant rate? Use a linear function.
Do you want the value to grow slow at first, but fast later? Use a polynomial or exponential function.
Do you want the value to grow fast at first, and slow down later? Use an nth-root or logarithmic function.
Do you want the value to grow slowly at the start/end but fast in the middle? Or do you want it to grow quickly but still have an upper-bound? Use a sigmoid curve, such as atan or the logistic function.
Do you want the value to oscillate? Use a sin or some other wave.
Then just tweak it (add/multiply stuff, change the base-value, etc) until it feels right. A graphing calculator will help you visualize how changes to the parameters will affect the function.

By the way, the problems you are experiencing are due to integer overflows.

Use variable-types that are large enough to hold the numbers you're working with. Sizes differ by platform in C++, but using the 32-bit Visual Studio compiler, unsigned int is 32-bit, while unsigned __int64 (MS-specific) is 64-bit. Also consider using a double.

Additionally, try to reorganize your operations so that you don't encounter such large numbers in the first place (for example, rather than MDef * MDef / 110, do (int)((float)MDef / 110 * MDef)).

If you're running into integer overflows, conversion to float - which only reliably supports 24 bits of integer part - is going to have a different set of accuracy problems

You left out one important variant as well, I think: If you want the damage to have an upper bound which you can get close to, but never quite reach, you can use a sigmoid function
There's your real problem: you defined your stats before defining what those stats actually mean. You're putting the cart before the horse.  I strongly disagree; the numbers in themselves are just a way to inform the player of his power, etc. it is part of the game design. If you proceed the other way round, you could end up with an end boss with 147hp... who wants that really?


Look at how D&D (tabletop) works. "Strength" doesn't mean anything by itself; it only means something because there's a rule that says, "Add your strength bonus to your melee attack." That rule is part of D&D's combat rules. Without the combat rules, "Strength" is generally a meaningless quantity.

The first question you need to ask yourself is this: how much differentiation do I want between characters? So just between Strength and Dexterity, you have two dimensions of play: ranged vs. melee.
You need to define the basic rules around stats before you can define growth progression functions and the like.

There are different ways to progress characters. A common old-school Final Fantasy trick was to simply use the character's level as part of their damage computations. This could be simply multiplying the level by the appropriate stat, or it could mean applying a function to the character's level. Say, a quadratic progression, so that the rate of a character's damage would increase per level.

However you want your combat functions to work, they need to take into account progression. Your functions need hooks for progression.

D&D has a funny way of progression. It is part class-based; every time you go up in level, you get new class features and a flat bonus to your to-hit, based on your character class. However, some class features got better by themselves.
D&D also used item-based progression heavily

So items are another thing your combat functions need to take into account. Do items just buff one or more stats while equipped, or do they do other things as well?

You could get away with 5 stats instead of 6. Defining a Hp range is one thing, but defining what basic stats you have is another. Stats require rules before you can make sense of them, and you have to know what you intend a stat to do before you can say that having that stat is a good idea

I'd recommend on focusing on simplicity.  For instance, could you have stats modify each other prior to damage calculation, rather than modifying the damage during the calculation? Obviously the fewer variables you have, them more feasible this will be.

For an MMO a good fast no-fat protocol is paramount Damage calculation is core gameplay, it should be designed with gameplay in mind, if you bring performance concerns into such a question you risk compromising the gameplay part

the enemy's health should be based on what the player can reasonably handle at that point, not the other way around

So you should write a simulation create a level 20 character, and see how he fares through 200 battles or so against the enemy types he's supposed to be fighting at that point. Do it again for a level 30 character (in presumably the next section of the world).

First start with a design, then start thinking about representing the design in formulas. The clearer your design the easier it should be to find simple and/or precise formulas.

Try to implement "types" of enemies, e.g. "armored" => a player attack if it is of type physical is reduced by 50%. Do not make a battle flow to abstract, think about what is relevant and what is not.

If your design says "armored enemies" are weak against magic but strong against physical damage, represent that in code. But remember that you have do a lot of testing, because the values won't work magically the first time you write the code. Try to create a design, put the logic into code, always check whether this the technical representation of what you had in mind and if it isn't change the values until it is.

I have came to one conclusion about designing math for RPG: Keep them as simple as possible. In design that I'm working on, I used very simplistic formulas, that are adequate to semi class-less system.
Ie. Fireball Spell have damage of 30. The forumal is:

BaseSpellDamage * Attribute (5 * 6)
We can also add modifiers like this:

Result = (BaseSpellDamage * Attribute) (5*6)
Result = Result + (Result * 50%) (30 = 30 + (30 * 50%))
So end result would be 45 damage. I found that using precentage multipliers is very easy, and very scalable solution to work with. Instead of coming with some odd numbers with complex math to figure out the result we want.

Now we can calulcate damage reseistance, that will just calcucate defense against set type of damage. There are two approaches and I honestly haven't decided which would suit better, but they both are simple and viable:

DamageResult = Resistance * Damage ( 50% * 45)
So the end result will be 22damage taken (I just cut the partial result).

Other formula:

DamageResult = Damage - Resistnace (45 - 22).
So end result will be 23. If it happen that resistance is bigger than damage taken then character just doesn't recieve any damage. Of course it's up to you to make sure that such situation have no place, except for when you want it be the case.

Although I must admit that precentage scaling is somewhat easier to balance and scale. But this also depends on your base numbers. Precentage scaling will work best if you start from 100 and up. If you are operating on small numbers (anything below 100 to be honest), it can get awkard as you will start getting floating point results, that will be hard to balance and actually do anything interesting with them. 

Probably optimal solution in that case is to use both approaches when they see to fit.

Do not use any advanced math, or long equations, as they are prone to errors, that are hard to spot, when you have to deal with 87234 other things at the same time.

How to properly preform computation with large numbers.
How you want and expect attack damage to behave against weaker and strong opponents.
How many attacks (turns), should it take to defeat that boss / minion?
How should different skills, buffs, debuffs affect x battle? Should it be hopeless, should winning be y% less / more likely?

Stats and Damages
Purely Stat-Based
This is a good idea if you want your characters to be flexible in terms of what levels of enemies they can challenge. A formula like this is only going to depend on the player's stats, their equipment, and the stats of the enemies. These formulas are usually fairly simple. Final Fantasy Legend II (See http://www.shenafu.com/ffl2/weapon.php for instance, has weapons that do damage based on the simple formula:

(Stat+StatBonus)*WeaponStrength - Defense*4
A formula like this is good if you want a very simple method of estimating damage, or a quick jumping off point for modifying damage based on other factors like skills and elemental weaknesses.

Stat- and Level-Based:
DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+STR)/256]
and the damage formula for staves is:

DMG = [ATK x RANDOM(1~1.125) - DEF] x [1 + STR x (Lv+MAG)/256]
They're very similar, but notice that the sword formula only depends on the strength and level, while the staff formula depends on strength, magic and level. The advantage to this kind of formula is that it allows the player two avenues of growth - building their stats, or building their levels. The downside is that it also penalizes characters both ways as well. What this really ends up doing is allowing the player to level up to increase their damage output (for FFXII this amounts increasing their damage output by ~4% per level around level 50 when you factor in stat gains) to help customize the difficulty to their comfort level.
